    "In this portfolio, we have 2 assets with different expected returns and volatility. Our task is to find the optimal weights subject to some risk constraints. Let's assume Asset $A$ has an annual return of 12% with volatility at 4%, Asset $B$ has an historical annual returns of 4% with volatility at 0.14% and both of them has a covariance of 0.2%. We start off by simulating **500** instances of their one-year ahead returns."
